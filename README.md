Data points in many modern datasets lie not along a single low-dimensional subspace,
but rather **cluster** around multiple low-dimensional **subspaces**
(as illustrated above).
This is sometimes called "union-of-subspace" structure
since the data points lie near the union of these low-dimensional subspaces.

Subspace clustering algorithms seek to cluster the data points
by their corresponding subspace - without knowing the subspaces a priori!
